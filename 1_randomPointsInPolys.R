# File: 1_randomPointsInPolys.r
# Purpose: GRTS sampling of EDM polygons to create spatially balanced random points
# these are the random presence points being created here, from polygon presence data.

library(spsurvey)
library(RSQLite)
library(rgdal)

####
# Assumptions
# - there is one shapefile for each element in the working directory listed below
# - the shapefile is named with the species code that is used in the lookup table
#   e.g. glypmuhl.shp
# - There is lookup data in the sqlite database to link to other element information (full name, common name, etc.)
# - the polygon shapefile has at least these fields EO_ID_ST, SNAME, SCOMNAME, RA

## these are the lines you need to change

### This is the shapefile that has your species polygon data. 
polydir <- "X:/RegionalSDM/ScirAnci/inputs/species/glypmuhl/polygon_data"
setwd(polydir)

### This is the directory you want the output data (random point shapefile) written to
outdir <- "X:/RegionalSDM/ScirAnci/inputs/species/glypmuhl/point_data"

### This is the full path and name of the information-tracking database
db_file <- "X:/RegionalSDM/ScirAnci/databases/SDM_lookupAndTracking.sqlite"
db <- dbConnect(SQLite(),dbname=db_file)

#look at the output and choose which shapefile you want to run
#enter its location in the list (first = 1, second = 2, etc)
